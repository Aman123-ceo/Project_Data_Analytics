# Project_Data_Analytics
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing real-world car data to understand how various factors such as brand, year, mileage, and fuel type affect selling prices. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, and OpenPyXL), the data is processed, visualized, and displayed through bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to find useful patterns and insights.
